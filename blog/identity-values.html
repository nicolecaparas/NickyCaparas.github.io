                <h3>Ethical Decision</h3>
                <p>My ethical decision was when I migrated overseas. In 2012, I went to China to further my career and
                    become less dependent on my Dad.
                    As years on went on living abroad, I became self-sufficient and was able to live by my own means and
                    international experience.</p>
                <p>With this, I was able to advance myself without being a burden to my Dad.</p>
                <h3>Cultural Influences</h3>
                <p> As a Filipino citizen by birth, we were taught to become hospitable. It is our nature to build
                    genuine relationships and friendships with other people.
