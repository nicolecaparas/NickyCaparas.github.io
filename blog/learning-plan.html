                </p>

                <h3>Long Term Goal</h3>

                <p>My long term is to become a full-stack developer.</p>

                <h3>Strengths and Limitations (in relation to learning)</h3>

                <p>At times of difficulty, I've put my mind at ease and think positive solutions to solve the problem.
                </p>

                <p>Sometimes, being the perfectionist I am, I lose track of time and focus to do other things in the
                    project: It's matter of tricking the mind, and starting new things to focus and have discipline with
                    it.</p>

                <h3>Human Skills</h3>
                <p>I would like to develop my time management skills when it comes to finishing a project.</p>

                <h3>Commitment</h3>

                <p>So far what works for me is how committed I am to finish one sprint per week.
                    I allow myself to learn and experiment on the project given to me.
                    Sometimes it takes a while to sink the information, so it's best to do one mindfulness before
                    starting the work; at the same time, give myself space to breathe and walk out from the PC for
                    awhile to
                    detox from it.</p>

                <h3>Commitment Aid</h3>

                <p>Curiosity is a good skill to come by especially when your developing a website.<br>
                    It is a skill that has been put to use and ask the questions that has been bothering me ever
                    since.</p>

                <p>To put that skill to use, I always research online and seek advice from my fellow peers.</p>

                <h3>Schedule Plan</h3>

                <p>I always plan my time to work from Monday to Friday.
                    I always see this program as another work day at the office.
                    It's also good to rest on the weekend and get breaks in between to re-focus on the lesson and
                    priority at hand.
