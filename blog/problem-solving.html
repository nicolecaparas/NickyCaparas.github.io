                    <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
                    <img style="float:left; max-width:25%" src="../images/mathproblem.jpg">
                    <p>Have you ever experienced solving a complicated math problem and you couldn't
                        figure it out? The only way you can solve the problem is by deciphering the
                        sentence and solving it again with a different solutions.</p>
                    <p>Do you you have the same experience every time you write a function with JavaScript?</p>
                    <p>Does it feel like déjà vu all over again?
                        In a manner of speaking, it does, and you're desperate to find the right answer. </p>
                    <p> Yesterday, I had phone conversation with my father on how difficult it was
                        to solve the problem in JavaScript. I was feeling the stress and even ranting out
                        my frustrations with coding. My father's only response to me was, "Think of JavaScript
                        as a Math problem." Then it hit me, how right he was.</p>
                    <p>I've organised my thoughts and re-evaluated the problem in front of me. I've read the
                        instructions over and over again and used different problem solving techniques
                        like googling on the web; doing console.logs; and asking questions to my facilitator
                        on how to solve the problem. In the end, I was able to solve it and learn to test and run
                        my functions using JavaScript.</p>
                    <h3>Problem-Solving Techniques</h3>
                    <img style="float:right; max-width:25%" src="../images/studygroup.jpg">
                    <ul style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">There are different
                        problem-solving techniques which I found useful to utilise.
                        Here are some of the techniques:
                        <br><br>
                        <li>Pseudocode: Its a great method to uncover unclear decisions,
                            hidden side effects and for defining all inputs, outputs,and
                            interactions needed to effectively solve my problem.

                        </li>

                        <li>Trying something: Its best practice to try the functions and
                            experiment on it so you will understand the context given to you.
                            It will also help improve your skills and become a critical thinker.

                        </li>

                        <li>Rubber ducky method: Its a process the helps me understand line-by-line the code
                            and also create conversation with an inanimate object before consoling
                            with an actual person.

                        </li>

                        <li>Reading error messages: Every time an error appears in your screen. You can check
                            the line of your code and omit on the changes until you get it right.
                        </li>
                        <li>Console.logging: It has been my best friend in doing rapid testing.
                            Especially if you want quick and dirty way of testing your functions.
                        </li>
                        <li>Googling: "Hey Google!" Isn't it amazing how google searches anything on the net.
                            Even asking for JavaScript references related to your problem can help guide you
                            in solving the problem.
                        </li>

                        <li>Asking your peers for help: "Two heads are better than one." It's nice
                            interact with your fellow peers especially trying to solve the same
                            problem at your own pace of understanding.

                        </li>

                        <li>Asking coaches for help: Your mentor is your best friend to guide
                            you in every step of the way to solve the problem. It's best practice
                            to learn from people who have experience with the matter and guide you
                            through it.
                        </li>
                        <li>Improving your process with reflection: It's a process that helps you reflect
                            and grow your abilities to learn something new and also pour out your frustrations
                            from time to time. It helps you balance mentally and physically as you progress on it.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>I want to show you an example of how I filter only even numbers with JavaScript</p>


                    <p id="raw-numbers">
                        1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <button id="filter-even-numbers">Only show me even numbers</button>
