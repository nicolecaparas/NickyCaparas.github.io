                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <h4>1.) An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS:</h4>
                <p>Let's say I have sentence, "The yellow bird sang." The bird is the noun in the sentence. Imagine the
                    noun as the HTML, this language describes what are the things on the page.
                    Then we have the color yellow which is the adjective. This describes the noun and therefore, like
                    the adjective, CSS can help us do that by describing the HTML elements, things on the page, make
                    this and that a different color, increase/decrease the size and many more. To top it all off, we add
                    JavaScript into the mix as being the verb ('sang') in the sentence: JavaScript describe its action
                    (i.e. the things
                    that its doing). In the end, all three help build our website and each has a different
                    responsibility.
                </p>

                <h4>2.) Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking
                    up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones):</h4>
                <p>
                    Loops allow us to repeat code if it satisfies a set of condition/s. There are different types of
                    loops: the <code>for</code> loop, <code>while</code> loop, <code>for..of</code> loop, and the
                    <code>for..in</code> loop.
                    If your condition returns <code>true</code>, your code block wll run, and then the condition will be
                    checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again.
                    It repeats until the condition returns false. It is like wearing your FitBit or Apple Watch: If you
                    start targeting or reaching your exercise goals it will continue to
                    count the steps/movements on your watch. The only time it will stop is once you remove your watch or
                    not even do any movements for that day.
                </p>

                <h4>3.)Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it:</h4>
                <p>DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and
                    update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
                    The DOM has separate set of rules which are implemented by all major browser makes and covers two
                    primary areas:
                    <strong>(a) Making a model of the HTML Page;</strong> <strong>(b) Accessing and changing the HTML
                        page.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                <p>As you work with the DOM tree you need to:</p>
                <p>A. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with:
                <ul class="dom">
                    <li>Selecting an individual element node: getElementById() / querySelector();</li>
                    <li>Selecting multiple elements (nodelists): <code>getElementByClassName()</code>
                        /<code> getElementByTagName()</code>/
                        <code>querySelectorAll();</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>Traversing between element nodes: <code>parentNode</code>
                        /<code> firstChild or lastChild</code>/ <code>previousSibling</code> or
                        <code>nextSibling</code>;
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    B.Use its text content, child elements and attributes.
                <ul class="dom2">
                    <li>Access/ update text nodes: <code>nodeValue</code></li>
                    <li>Work with HTML Content:<code> innerHTML</code>
                        /<code> textContent</code> / <code>CreateElement()</code>or
                        <code>CreateTextNode()</code>or
                        <code>appendChild()</code> /<code>removeChild()</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>Access or update attribute values: <code>hasAttribute()</code> /
                        <code>getAttribute()</code>/ <code>setAttribute()</code> /
                        <code>removeAttribute()</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                </p>

                <h4> 4.)Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects:</h4>

                <p>
                    <strong>Array</strong>
                    <br>
                    Array is a special data type in JavaScript. It doesn't just store one value -- it stores a list of
                    values.
                    It is an ordered collection of values similar to the songs in a playlist: When you create a playlist
                    of songs you have different methods you can do like: delete, add, replay, play from start to end
                    songs and many more.
                    Just like an array there are different methods as well to access your data:
                <ul class="arrays">
                    <li>
                        push : add an array to end </li>
                    <li>
                        pop : remove an array from the end </li>
                    <li>
                        shift: remove an array from the start </li>
                    <li>
                        unshift: add array to the start </li>
                    <li>
                        concat: merge array </li>
                    <li>
                        includes: look for a value </li>
                    <li>
                        indexOf: searches for a value inside the array and returns its index.<br>Returns -1 if the value
                        does not exist. </li>
                    <li>
                        join: creates a string from a array </li>
                    <li>
                        reverse: reverses an array </li>
                    <li>
                        slice: copies a portion on an array </li>
                    <li>
                        splice: removes/ replaces elements </li>
                    <li>
                        sort: sorts an array </li>
                </ul>

                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Objects</strong>
                    <br>
                    Objects are also a special data type in JavaScript. Just like arrays, objects are going to help
                    store multiple pieces of data together in some sort
                    of structure. But unlike arrays where the whole point is to order our data, this is not the case
                    with objects. Instead, our data is stored using what
                    we call key-value pairs or properties. So imagine if you have a bag of gems with different property
                    types (like shape, size, color, type, etc.): These pieces of
                    gems have no order but they are in one bag that are appealing and amazing to look at and its easy to
                    take remove or add from the bag when you know the type you're looking for.
                    This is how similar objects are when you store and access data. These data need access key to get
                    these bits of information with correct label on it.

                </p>

                <h4>5.)Explain what functions are and why they are useful:</h4>
                <p> Functions allow us to write reusable, modular code. We define a "chunk" of code that we can then
                    execute at a later point.We use them all the time and its 2-step process which is to "define it" and
                    then "run with it". A
                    good analogy would be a washer-dryer combo appliance.
                    You put in clothes inside of it, and apart from washing the clothes, it also dries them after it
                    finishes washing them, saving you time.
