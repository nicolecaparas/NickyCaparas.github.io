                    <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
                    <h4>Research</h4>
                    <h5>Discuss what is growth mindset and why it is relevant:</h5>
                    <p>Growth mindset is a belief that if you struggle in a certain skills, over time with hard work
                        and patience you can improve on it. Having that mindset, motivates you to work and accept any
                        failures.
                    </p>
                    <h5>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h5>
                    <p>Having a growing mindset will motivate me to learn new programming languages and accept
                        the challenges ahead of me. If I have a mindset, "I can do it", it will help me focus and
                        aim my goal to learn and accept growth with the challenges ahead of me.
                    <h5>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h5>
                    <p>If I integrate my growth mindset with my learning journey, it will help shape and embrace
                        challenges.
                        It will also help me in the long run to take risks, experience ups and downs, and motivate to do
                        better. It's a matter of creating a routine, being mindful, and pacing yourself with the lessons. It's best
                        practice to be positive and opened to learn new things everyday.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and
                        strategy:</h5>
                    <p>My understanding to Neuroplasticity is that you can learn new tricks and abilities if you have a
                        mindset for it. It is best practice to remain active, engage, and involve to face challenges ahead. It
                        will help me open new opportunities to grow and implement these techniques as I go further with the
                        lessons
