                    <h3>Foundation-Reflections</h3>
                    <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>
                    <p>I learned how to become mindful, be resourceful, but more importantly, be curious going through these core learnings. 
                    Curiosity always drives me to do better with my code.</p>
                    <h4>What are the roles of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
                    <p>The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness helped strengthen my learning and programming. 
                    Those traits kept me grounded in the process of opening my mind to new paradigms.</p>
                    <h4>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h4>
                    <p>The thing which surprises me with the core learning is making time to meditate and 
                    reflect on other stuff before going through the technical aspect of the learning.</p>
                    <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
                    <p>The most challenging aspects of the core learning was trying to manage the time given to me and also trying to solve the challenges as I go further along.
                    The exercises were a bit confusing at first, but I finally found myself accepting that these are exactly the types of challenges a programmer goes through every day.</p>
                    <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>
                    <p>I think the reason for spending much time on core learning is to help students grow both physically and mentally, giving them a holistic idea of how programming works before we plunge into the harder stuff.
                    It helps lessen the stress, while we slowly understand the lesson at hand. It also shows progression on communication skills and reflects on the importance of a growing mindset. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
                    Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
                    <p>I feel core learning helps balance out one’s mental state and, while hard, gives us the proper fundamental knowledge to solve problems without having to resort to skewed code.
                    It gets harder to focus on your studies if you do not balance it out. Core learning improves your understanding of the concepts behind the lessons moving forward.</p>
