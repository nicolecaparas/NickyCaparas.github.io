                <h3>Learning Plan</h3>

                <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
                <p>My long term goal is to become a full-time front-end developer after I finish this course. 
                The stuff I’ve gone through with this Bootcamp will help me get through with the actual work/ job in the future. 
                I am very excited about the things I can do with JavaScript and CSS</p>

                <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
                <p>My biggest strengths with this Bootcamp is doing mindfulness before doing any course work.
                 At the same, trying to focus and expand my mind with new learning. Using my design background, I can merge the two and utilise my creativity when it comes to coding.
                However, I know I have limited skills in terms of understanding Javascript when it gets too complicated.
                I know moving forward, this Bootcamp will help me understand JS and practice it more in real life and real projects.
                </p>

                <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
                <p>I think the biggest non-technical challenge for me in Bootcamp is working in pairs or groups when it comes to programming. 
                It will be different for me to drive or test with another person/s when you try to achieve the same goal/ purpose. 
                Especially trying to focus on the technical challenges that await me.</p>

                <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
                <p>I would like to develop my communication skills when explaining things to my peers, especially on the technical front. 
                I’m not good at explaining it technically, but I am up for the challenge, and I should become more fluent over time.</p>

                <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
                <p>My expectation from the Bootcamp team is to take their time with us when things get harder for us in the long run. 
                Access to more resources and videos are always appreciated.</p>

                <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h4>
                <p>My expectation for the upcoming Bootcamp is to keep calm and manage my time wisely when it comes to work. 
                I know it will be a challenge for me to learn new stuff and get with the program. But I know I will be able to learn more
                from it and with others as well.</p>
                
                <h4>My Commitment</h4>
                <p>I am committed to managing my time and dedicated to making an effort to learn more and challenge myself when it comes to programming. 
                I want to have a mindset to learn from others and be open to changes. 
                There are times I know where I will feel stressed or fussed about it, but I need to just step out and give myself a break every once in a while to get a fresh perspective on things. 
                I need to allow myself to be patient and kind to myself and ask for help when things get challenging.</p>
